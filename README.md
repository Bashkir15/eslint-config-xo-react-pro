> A modern xo-based linting solution for modern Javascript applications

Xo-React-Pro is a modular linting configuration for xo and base ESLint. Not using React? Each section of the linter can be consumed as its own standalone component. This makes things like customizing and combining which features you want without having to overwrite a ton of rule simple. 

## Install

```
$ yarn install -D eslint-config-xo-react-pro
```
